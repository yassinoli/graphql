# ⚠️  GraphQL Dashboard — Hacker Mode Activated

> *"You don't surf the web, you hack it. Data flows through me like a stream of green code."

Welcome to the **underground GraphQL interface**. This isn't your grandma's dashboard; this is where the info gets ripped from the servers and shown in raw neon.

🚨 **Hacker style enabled** by default:
- Black matte background with pulsating green text
- Monospace fonts and flicker animations make you feel like you're inside the matrix
- Aggressive glow effects highlight every card and button

### How to customize
1. Open `css/home.css` and `css/login.css`.
2. Tweak the `:root` variables (colors, fonts) to your pleasure.
3. Add your own ascii art or terminal-inspired backgrounds if you're feeling extra dark.

> Remember: in this realm, you're not just a user; you're the one with the keys.

🛠 **Development**

```bash
# start your local server (whatever you use)
npm install
npm run dev
```

Stay sharp, keep the terminal open, and enjoy the view. 👾
